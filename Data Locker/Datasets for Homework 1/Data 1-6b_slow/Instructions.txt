Note:
-All data files named 'u_ ...' are inputs.
-All data files named 'y_ ...' are outputs.
-All data files named 'Theta_ ...' are parameters.
Directions:

1) Start by using the input-output data in the 'Test Data' folder to make sure your code is correct. The parameters used to generate the output are constant and are theta = [5 -2 3]'.


2) For part a) of your assignment, run your algorithm on the input-outuput data in the 'Data 1-6a' folder. The time courses of the true parameters are provided.


3) For part b) of your assignment, run your algorithm on the input-outuput data in the 'Data 1-6b' folder. The time courses of the true parameters are provided.


4)****Please turn in your source code****
